One new concept discovered is the notion of a Master Resume which I have proposed all along, but now published as a concept by http://www.job-hunt.org/resumes/master-resume-for-linkedin.shtml for LinkedIn since you cannot create multiple linkedIn profiles. Similar is http://www.job-hunt.org/job-search-for-academics/kitchen-sink-resume.shtml 

Careful consideration must be taken when presenting dual careers http://www.job-hunt.org/resumes/master-resume-for-linkedin.shtml

<description id="2">Studied multiple languages although with a primary concentration in code generators like Lisp like languages, YAML,JSON, XML and what IDE's and emacsen have to offer. Quite well aware of Java and .NET, but with the advent and proliferation of open-source frameworks and serialization stores like Rails, Joomla, YAML and JSON these offer a way of working with larger chunks of code to be hooked together accelerating application development and is I think a more effective way than working with just classes and objects (their components). YAML, JSON, XML can be used also to auto-generate class code with a little ingenuity. Also if there is a need for speed CH a C/C++ interpreter (allows manipulating pointers on the command line) can be used to more rapidly develop in C-code and then finishing off by using the compilation process. This is native code and not managed code as in .Net.</description></item>
